I have always been a bit interested in 3d modeling and designing and decided to give Cinema 4D a shot after seeing what Andreas Wannerstedt created with it and some help with Adobe After Effects. I have no plans to make anything as advanced as what he did but playing around with the physics and such is a lot of fun and very interesting. Here is the link to Andreas's video on Vimeo called Genesis: [http://vimeo.com/33294114](http://vimeo.com/33294114 "Genesis") So what I have done looks nothing like that and I have only been playing around with the program for about 5 hours but this is what I have come up with so far. My name in 3D with particles that create and destroy it.<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2aNQDS-Y-c&feature=g-upl&context=G26664fcAUAAAAAAABAA> And then I made several blocks, I believe it comes out to 125 blocks in total and changed the resolution a bit.<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hpx7VwoSBSU&feature=g-upl&context=G2529b24AUAAAAAAAAAA> Hopefully I will be able to create a nice looking video one day but it will be a little while until I am ready.
